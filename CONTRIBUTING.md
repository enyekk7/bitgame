## How to Contribute

### üéÆ Adding a New Game

#### React Game (Internal)

1. Create game folder:
```bash
mkdir -p apps/web/src/games/your-game
```

2. Add `manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "slug": "your-game",
  "name": "Your Game",
  "description": "Description here",
  "thumbnail": "/games/your-game-thumb.png",
  "type": "react",
  "category": "arcade"
}
```

3. Create `index.tsx`:
```tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import BitgameBridge from '../../sdk/BitgameBridge';

export default function YourGame() {
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);

  const endGame = () => {
    const bridge = new BitgameBridge();
    bridge.gameOver(score);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your game UI */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

4. Add to seed data in `apps/api/src/seed.ts`

#### HTML Game (External)

1. Create game folder:
```bash
mkdir -p games-external/your-game
```

2. Add `manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "slug": "your-game",
  "name": "Your Game",
  "description": "Description here",
  "thumbnail": "/games/your-game-thumb.png",
  "type": "html",
  "category": "casual"
}
```

3. Create `index.html` with game logic

4. Send game-over message:
```javascript
window.parent.postMessage({
  type: 'bitgame',
  event: 'game-over',
  data: { score: yourScore, metadata: {} }
}, '*');
```

5. Sync: `pnpm sync:games`
